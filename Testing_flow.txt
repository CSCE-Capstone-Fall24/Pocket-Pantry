Roll out the second disc of pie crust until it is ⅛ inch thick and lay it over the apple filling.', 'Use a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside edge of the pie plate. Lift the edges where the two pie crusts meet, gently press to seal and fold them under. Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges are neatly tucked under themselves. Cut 4 slits in the top of the dough to allow steam to vent. Place the pie on a baking sheet.', 'Brush the surface of the pie crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Cover the edges with a pie shield or a strip of foil to keep them from over browning during the first 25 minutes.', 'Bake at 400°F for 25 minutes.

Cool at room temperature for at least 3 hours.']
